# PID_Temperature_Controller
C/C++ multi-threaded code for PID temperature controller and logger with Teensy 4.1 microcontroller 

P = Proportional (How fast the system responds)  
I = Integral (Used to remove steady state error)   
D = Derivative (Used to speed up the response of the system)

# PID Tuning recommendations:   
Derivative can add noise to the system   
Set I and D to zero then tune P  
Tune I when satisfied with P controllers response 
D can be left at 0 if a PI controller is suitable for your needs
